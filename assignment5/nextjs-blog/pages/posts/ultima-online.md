Game Description:

> One of the first major MMORPG sandboxes: open PvP (on early shards), player housing, crafting, and a living economy. Skills improve through use rather than levels, enabling true roleplay flexibility. It’s remembered for emergent stories—heists, town life, and the thrill of real loss.
